0 - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

        The number, followed by
            if the number is greater than 0: is positive
            if the number is 0: is zero
            if the number is less than 0: is negative
        followed by a new line
1-This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

            if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
            if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
        followed by a new line
